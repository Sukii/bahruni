"Aryabhata rejected the story of a daanava (demon) named Rahu swallowing the sun or his tail Ketu covering the moon during eclipses. Eclipses occurred due to shadows, he said, and he did not see any shadow of a tail!
Brahmagupta, who came more than a century later, was a great mathematician himself but did not agree with Aryabhata about rejecting the Rahu-Ketu myth and criticised him and his followers scathingly.
However, one of these, Varahamihira (505-587 CE), dismissed Brahmagupta's arguments as 'absurdities' as Brahmagupta's predictions of eclipses were also based on the shadow theory (This inconsistency in Brahmagupta was Al Biruni's main target)!
One thing I learnt from all this was that the debate between mythology and 'rational' science in India is at least as old as Aryabhata and Brahmagupta and, to this day, has not been resolved in the Indian popular thinking on science."
-- [Roddam Narasimha](https://www.rediff.com/news/interview/why-and-how-did-science-in-india-stagnate/20150814.htm)


Although Roddam Narasimha slurs over all the intrigues of brahminism, this is very well captured by [Abha Sur](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8189059327/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0).

CV Raman discovered Raman scattering (along with K.S.Krishnan, who made imortant contributions to science, but remains quite inconspicuous). It was no less than Albert Einstein who first clearly emphasized the importance of Raman's discovery and mentioned that it shows unlike Newtonian optics it emphasized the origin light spectrum in the material property of matter. After discovery of atomic spectrum by Bohr, this further opened-up the field of atmic spectroscopy. Einstein further discovered the corpuscular nature of light (for which he was given Nobel prize) emphasizing the material nature of light particle itself.
Megnath Saha emphasized it further by explaining how by studying the optical spectrum of light originating from stars we can explain the material composition of stars. The role of CV Raman in refusing to sopport the cause of Nobel prize for his important contributions to Plasma physiccs is well known. It was the same arrogant attitude of CV Raman that caused the Lahore-born Chandrasekar (nephew of CV Raman) to leave India for Cambridge (where he faced bitter resistance for his theory of black holes from Cambridge patriarch Erwin Schrodinger, who played important role in confirming the predictions of special relativity).

The tradition of spectroscopy that CV Raman and KS Krishnan pioneered was continued by GN Ramachandran, who explained the triple helix strcture of ligands. This tradition was continued by "Venki" Venkatraman Ramachandran (who is now the President of the Royal Society) who was recently given Nobel prize for comprehenively explaining structure and function of RNA. "Venki" is horrified at the state of Indian science that is beeing attacked by religious obscurantism.

Recently the religious obscuratists and RSS brahmins have been appropriating the achievements of the discoveries of science of people of brahmin-origin to justify its fraudulent activities and religious obscurantism. It is true that before the arrival of caste sytem in the Gangetic plain scince in India had important contributions from people of all walks of life. The fact that caste system did not arrive in Southern India till much later and the fact that there was international trade in the West coast developed helped in the development teh Kerla School of Science and Mathematics. The idea of cycle and epicycles in the study of astronomy contributed to the theory of continued fractions. This tradition was continued by Srinivas Ramnujam after many centuries. The English speaking Madras brahmin class that neglected Srinivas Ramnujam and was not capable of encouraging or assessing his talent, who left him to die in penury in Cambridge, were never capable of assessing his capability. It was left to GH Hardy to polish this dimaond among cow dung, while at the same time fighting English Aryan racists who would not allow Ramnujan to become a member of the Royal Society. After many decades of silence, it was George Andrews of the United States who had to rediscover his notes, which is even now kept in an abject condition and poor state in Madras University (only laminating it now, without knowing any basics of manuscript preservation). 

No less a person than George Sudarshan, who was refused three nobel prizes (including one for grand unification), who converted from being a Syrian Christian to Hindu by Brahma Samaj, only to be left high and dry by the brahmin ruling class for not being through-born. He was booted-out as the director of the Instiute of Mathematical Sciences by various back door intrigues and manuevers, typical of the brahmin ruling class and died a bitter man neglected by both his own country and the academicians of the world of science. His only consolation came from the foremost scientist of Asian-origin Abdus Salam, who received Nobel prize for his contributions to the grand unification theory in physics. As soon as Salam became director of International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, he constituted an important award in physics and awarded it to his good friend in 1985 [Physics Prize of the Third World Academy of Sciences](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/024/02/0245-0252).

As emphasized by [Venki](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/science-depends-on-being-able-to-question-authority/article30589249.ece) science will only flourish in a society that can tolerate questioning it's ruling class. Paying lip service to science through [Science Congress tamashas](https://thewire.in/politics/not-a-congress-but-a-big-fat-indian-science-wedding) will not serve any purpose other than degrading it.

Jawaharlal Nehru created and declared that the engineering and science institutes as the modern temples of progress, but it also meant that it has been captured by the same ruling class that has perpetuated religious obscurantism in Indian polity, so science in India remains in lamentable condition, both at instituitional and social level, struck in a semi-feudal semi-capitalist society unable to wriggle out its religious Hindutva cucoon.
